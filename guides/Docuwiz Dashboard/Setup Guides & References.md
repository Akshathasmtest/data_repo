From the **Getting Started** section on the **Docuwiz Dashboard**, select **Setup Guides & References**. 

The Setup Guides & References option in the Docuwiz Dashboard allows you to import, manage, and sync your API documentation files directly within your workspace. 

You can upload files manually or connect a source control repository for automated synchronization.

## **Importing Documentation Files**

You can easily bring existing documentation into Docuwiz using built\-in import options. Docuwiz provides three ways to import your documentation files into the platform.

### **Drag\-and\-Drop Upload**

- Drag your .yaml or .json specification files directly into the upload area.
- Docuwiz automatically detects, parses, and imports these files as **API References**.

### **Browse Files**

- Click **Browse Files** to manually select files from your local system.
- **Supported formats:**
  - .md \(for Guides\)
  - .yaml, .yml, .json \(for API References\)

### **Connect Source Control**

- Click the **Connect Source Control** button \(blue\) to link your **GitHub** or **GitLab** repository.
- Once connected, Docuwiz automatically imports your specification files and keeps them synced with your source repository.
- **Supported formats:** .yaml, .yml, .json, .md
- No additional configuration is required—Docuwiz automatically detects and imports all valid files.
